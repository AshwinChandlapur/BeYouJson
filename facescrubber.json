Lycopene is an antioxidant that helps protects your skin from dangerous UV sun rays and it also prevents wrinkles by maintaining your skin’s elasticity. Sugar is also great for your skin because it’s a natural humectant. Humectants help retain moisture, so the sugar helps pull moisture into your skin and keep it there.",
